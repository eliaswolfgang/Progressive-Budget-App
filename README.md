# Progressive Budget App

A progressive web app for budgeting which works offline - if you lose your internet connection, no worries!

## Description

This is a full-stack budgeting application built using MongoDB (mongoose) and Express. The app also utilizes IndexedDB to create transactions offline, bulk those transactions, and display them to the user both while the app is offline and when the app comes back online.

This app is designed for avid travelers who want to keep track of their finances: hikers, campers, or those exploring the world without reliable internet access.

## Development

For further development purposes, simply clone this repository and run ```npm i``` in the root directory. Run ```npm watch``` to load the server using nodemon.js and make changes with instant visibility!
